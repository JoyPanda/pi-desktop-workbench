# Contributing to Orbit

Thanks for your interest in Orbit. This guide covers how to set up the project,
what we expect from changes, and how to get them merged.

## Before you start

- **Open an issue first** for anything larger than a bug fix or a small
  documentation change. Architectural work is recorded in `INTENT.md`, so a
  quick discussion saves rework.
- Read [`AGENT.md`](AGENT.md) before touching the code. It is the project's
  convention and protocol reference. When it conflicts with
  [`INTENT.md`](INTENT.md) on architecture, `INTENT.md` wins.
- By participating you agree to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Ways to contribute

- Report bugs with the [issue form](https://github.com/imrj05/orbit/issues/new/choose).
- Propose features with the feature-request form.
- Improve docs (`README.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `AGENT.md`, `INTENT.md`).
- Submit pull requests for open roadmap items.

## Development setup

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (1.94+ preferred)
- Xcode command line tools (the app renders with Metal on macOS)
- The [pi coding agent CLI](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) installed and
  authenticated — Orbit drives pi as a child process, so live tests and the app
  need it. Tests that require `pi` skip cleanly when it is absent.

### Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imrj05/orbit.git
cd orbit
cargo run -p orbit-pi
```

### Verify before opening a PR

```bash
cargo build --workspace      # must stay clean: zero warnings
cargo test --workspace       # unit tests + live pi integration tests
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
```

`cargo build` with zero warnings is a stated project invariant. CI runs build
and clippy on macOS (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`); tests are run locally, not in
CI.

For UI changes, launch the app (`cargo run -p orbit-pi`) and confirm the
affected surface works. Notifications need an app bundle — use
`scripts/run-bundled.sh`. For a rebuild-and-relaunch loop on save,
`cargo install bacon && bacon run`.

## Project invariants

These are non-negotiable; a PR that breaks one will be asked to change.

1. **No web in the UI.** New UI is GPUI only. Do not reintroduce React, Vite,
   Tauri, webviews, a DOM, Tailwind, or Node tooling.
2. **The pi CLI is the only agent runtime.** Speak its JSONL RPC over stdio
   (`crates/orbit-rpc`). There is no Node daemon.
3. **GPUI is pinned.** `gpui = "0.2.2"`. Upgrade deliberately, never track `main`.
4. **Performance is a product requirement.** Virtualize large lists and never
   block a frame with I/O.
5. **Trust pi's truth.** Render real RPC events and on-disk state; never fake a
   control that does not work.
6. **No `unsafe` without a comment; no new dependency without a stated reason.**

Full detail lives in `AGENT.md` → *Hard rules*.

## Commit and branch conventions

The history follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
`type(scope): summary` in the imperative mood.

```
feat(access-guard): prompt inline with allowlistable tool approvals
fix(transcript): keep tail-follow after remeasure
docs: add contributing guide
chore: update 10 files
```

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`.
Use the module name as the scope where it helps (`transcript`, `review`,
`access-guard`, `git-panel`, …).

Branch names are short and descriptive:

```
feat/parallel-sessions
fix/sidebar-watcher
docs/open-source-files
```

When a pull request from an outside contributor is merged into `main`, the
maintainer credits them by adding a bullet to the `### Contributors` list under
`[Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`:

```
python3 scripts/changelog-contributors.py \
  --pr 63 --login bougieL --title "fix(macos): reopen the window from the Dock"
```

The script is idempotent (a PR already credited anywhere in the changelog is
left alone), and `scripts/bump-version.sh` rolls the list into the release
section, so the credit ships with the release notes.

## Pull requests

1. Fork the repository and branch from `main`.
2. Keep the change focused; unrelated cleanup belongs in its own PR.
3. Fill in the pull-request template checklist.
4. Make sure build, tests, and clippy pass locally.
5. Update the docs in the same PR: `INTENT.md` → *Implementation status* (and a `D#`
   decision if the architecture changed), the `README.md` features/roadmap, and an
   `[Unreleased]` `CHANGELOG.md` entry. A shipped feature is not done until the docs
   describe it.
6. Push and open the PR. Link the issue it addresses.

A maintainer will review. Expect comments on architecture fit, performance, and
the invariants above.

## Releasing

The version lives in `crates/orbit-pi/Cargo.toml` and is the single source of
truth. Changing it on `main` is all it takes: CI tags the version and builds
the release. Notes come from `CHANGELOG.md`.

1. Add what changed under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog
   sections: Added / Changed / Fixed). `scripts/bump-version.sh` **refuses to
   bump when `[Unreleased]` has no changes**. For a first draft from the commits
   since the last tag, run `scripts/changelog-build.py --write`, then edit the
   bullets into prose; `--force` replaces notes that are already there. When
   `[Unreleased]` is intentionally left empty, override the guard to fall back
   to the generated log:

   ```bash
   ALLOW_EMPTY_CHANGELOG=1 ./scripts/bump-version.sh 0.0.2
   ```

   With the override (or any release whose `[Unreleased]` stayed empty), the
   notes are synthesized in the Next.js release-log style — `### Core Changes` /
   `### Documentation Changes` / `### Misc Changes`, bullets ending `: #<PR>`,
   and a `### Credits` line — from the commits since the previous tag
   (`scripts/release-notes.py --from-git`). A real `[Unreleased]` entry is still
   preferred.
2. Bump and push:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/bump-version.sh 0.0.2
   ```

   That sets the version in both crates and the bundled pi extensions, refreshes
   `Cargo.lock`, rolls `[Unreleased]` under a new `[0.0.2]` heading, then commits
   `chore(release): v0.0.2` and pushes to `main`. `NO_PUSH=1` stops before the
   push. Editing the version in `crates/orbit-pi/Cargo.toml` and pushing by hand
   works the same way.

3. `.github/workflows/release.yml` sees the new version on `main` and builds
   every platform. Tags are never hand-cut: once the builds finish, the
   workflow creates the annotated tag `v0.0.2` at the commit it built, so every
   tag points at a commit whose artifacts exist. Running the workflow by hand
   (Actions → Release → Run workflow) rebuilds a leftover draft; a published
   release is never rebuilt.

4. The workflow then:

   - resolves the version from `crates/orbit-pi/Cargo.toml` (the source of truth);
   - **macOS** — builds the arm64 and universal `.app`s, signs them with your
     Developer ID, notarizes and staples each `.app` and DMG, and emits an
     updater `.tar.gz` for each (`scripts/make-dmg.sh`);
   - **Linux** — builds `orbit-pi` and packages a `.tar.gz` plus a native `.deb`
     (`scripts/bundle-linux.sh`);
   - **Windows** — builds `orbit-pi.exe` and ships it both bare and in a `.zip`
     (`scripts/bundle-windows.ps1`);
   - **drafts** a GitHub Release on tag `v0.0.2` whose notes are the `[0.0.2]`
     section of `CHANGELOG.md` (`scripts/release-notes.py`; an empty section
     falls back to the Next.js-style release log built from commits since the
     previous tag). The same notes ship as an `Orbit-Pi-0.0.2.md` release asset.

   Review the draft and publish it. macOS signing needs the Apple secrets listed
   at the top of the workflow file; without them the macOS job builds unsigned
   DMGs, and if Apple refuses the notary credentials it falls back to signed but
   un-notarized DMGs with a warning. Windows and Linux are `continue-on-error`
   while those platforms are validated.

5. The same job signs each artifact and attaches the update feeds to the
   release itself (`scripts/appcast.py`), so a published release serves them at
   `https://github.com/imrj05/orbit/releases/latest/download/appcast-<os>-<arch>.xml`.
   Nothing is committed back to `main`.

Assets and the bundled pi extensions are compiled into the binary
(`include_dir!` / `include_str!`), so every artifact is self-contained.

### In-app updates

The updater verifies every downloaded artifact against an Ed25519 public key
compiled into the binary (`ORBIT_UPDATE_PUBLIC_KEY`). Generate the keypair once:

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out orbit-update.pem

# Public key → repository secret ORBIT_UPDATE_PUBLIC_KEY
openssl pkey -in orbit-update.pem -pubout -outform DER | tail -c 32 | base64

# Private key → repository secret ORBIT_UPDATE_PRIVATE_KEY
base64 -i orbit-update.pem
```

Add both under Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions, and keep
`orbit-update.pem` somewhere safe — lose it and you can never sign another
update. With no public key the updater stays dormant, and debug builds never
update themselves.

To exercise the flow from a dev build, compile the public key in and force the
updater on:

```bash
ORBIT_UPDATE_PUBLIC_KEY="$(openssl pkey -in orbit-update.pem -pubout -outform DER | tail -c 32 | base64)" \
ORBIT_FORCE_UPDATER=1 cargo run
```

A run outside a managed install checks and opens the modal (search, changelog,
Version History) but offers no **Update now** — installing needs the bundled
`.app`. **Check for Updates** on a build with no updater at all opens the same
modal with an explanation, never a toast.

Each feed's `<enclosure>` must point at an artifact the updater can install —
a Sparkle appcast cannot describe an architecture, which is why there is one
feed per target:

| Platform | Feed points at |
|---|---|
| macOS | `Orbit-Pi-<version>-universal.tar.gz`, one top-level `Orbit Pi.app` |
| Linux | `orbit-pi-<version>-<triple>.tar.gz`, containing `bin/orbit-pi` |
| Windows | a `*-Setup.exe` installer — **not built yet**; the current zip cannot be installed in place |
