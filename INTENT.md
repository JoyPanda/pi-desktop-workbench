# INTENT.md — Decisions, rationale, and plan

This file captures **why** Orbit was rebuilt as a native app and the decisions that shape it.
It is the source of truth for architecture choices; when AGENT.md or README.md conflict with
a decision recorded here, this file wins. Update it when a decision changes (and say why).

**Maintenance contract:** every shipped feature updates the *Implementation status* below — and
adds or revises a `D#` decision when the architecture changed. A feature is not done until this
file describes it. `CHANGELOG.md` records what shipped; this file records why, and the
architecture that follows from it.

## Vision

Orbit is a **100% Rust, GPU-rendered desktop workbench for the pi coding agent** —
the same architecture as Waku, scoped to pi only — with **every current feature preserved**:

- no browser, no webview, no Node.js daemon anywhere in the app
- UI rendered by GPUI (the framework Zed is built on) on Metal
- the pi CLI (`pi --mode rpc`) as the only agent runtime, spoken to over stdio JSONL
- same sessions as the terminal (`~/.pi/agent/sessions/`), pi's own catalog, thinking levels, and persistence

## Decisions

### D1 — Transport: pi CLI RPC over stdio (replaces the Node daemon + SSE)
**Choice:** spawn `pi --mode rpc` as a child process per open session; JSONL commands on stdin,
JSONL events on stdout. Retire `agent/` (pi-coding-agent SDK daemon) and the SSE surface.

**Rationale (verified against the official RPC spec, `packages/coding-agent/docs/rpc.md`):**
- streaming text/thinking, tool calls, model catalog (`get_available_models`), thinking levels
  (`get_available_thinking_levels`), prompt-with-images, steer/abort/clear_queue, session ops
  (switch/new/fork/clone/rename/get_tree/get_entries), slash commands (`get_commands`)
- user interaction via the extension UI sub-protocol (`extension_ui_request`/`extension_ui_response`:
  `select`/`confirm`/`input`/`editor` dialogs) — covers question prompts and approval UI
- providers CRUD and scoped models are file-based (`~/.pi/…` config), readable/writable from Rust
- removes Node as a runtime, the bundled `pi-sse.mjs` sidecar, and localhost port management

**Residual risk:** per-tool *permission* requests in RPC mode are unverified (pi's permission
system is TUI/launch-flag territory; Waku sidesteps with `--approve`). **Resolved:** pi core has no
per-tool permission surface in RPC mode and no sandbox, but an extension's `tool_call` hook can
block/confirm and `ctx.ui.select` *does* surface over RPC as `extension_ui_request`. Orbit ships
`contrib/orbit-guard-extension/` for its Supervised / Auto-accept edits / Full access modes rather
than faking a pi-native mode. `--approve` is project trust (a separate concern). The Node daemon is
removed and is not a fallback.

### D2 — Mermaid diagrams
**Choice:** code-block fallback first; no diagram rendering in the P0–P3 core. Later, evaluate
(a) graphviz DOT for flowchart/sequence, or (b) a hidden native WKWebView used solely as a
**rasterizer** (render → snapshot image → GPU image; the Waku `browser.rs` pattern), or
(c) a custom GPUI renderer (only if we own enough of the diagram types).
**Reason:** no good native Rust Mermaid exists; a full custom renderer is 2–3 weeks and still
won't cover gantt/pie. This is the one accepted feature regression in the migration. Never
present a diagram that isn't rendered — render a copyable code block instead.

### D3 — Rollout: full commit to GPUI (supersedes the original staged plan)
**Choice (revised):** the web stack (React/Vite/Tauri/Node daemon) was **removed from the repo** and the GPUI app is the only app. The original plan kept both apps alive until chat parity; that was superseded when the web stack was deleted at the user's direction.
**Consequence:** with no fallback UI, the GPUI app is the product, and the parity contract below was the build-forward backlog rather than a switch-over checklist. P3/P4 have since landed (see Implementation status); the deleted web app remains recoverable from git history if a reference implementation is ever needed.

### D4 — GPUI pinned to crates.io, not tracking main
**Choice:** `gpui = { version = "0.2.2", features = ["runtime_shaders"] }` — upgrades are
deliberate and scheduled, never `git main`.
**Reason:** pre-1.0 API with frequent breaking changes; reproducibility for users and CI.
**Note:** `runtime_shaders` compiles Metal shaders at app start via the GPU driver, because this
machine lacks the Xcode MetalToolchain (`metal` CLI). For release builds, consider installing
the Metal toolchain and precompiling shaders (drop the feature) to shave startup time.

### D5 — Platform: macOS first-class, Windows/Linux shipped best-effort
**Choice (revised):** macOS is the first-class target — signed + notarized `.app`/DMG, native
window chrome and menu bar, desktop notifications. Windows (`scripts/bundle-windows.ps1` → Inno
Setup installer / bare `.exe`) and Linux (`scripts/bundle-linux.sh` → `.deb` / `.tar.gz`) build
from the same codebase and ship via `.github/workflows/release.yml`; they are best-effort
(`continue-on-error`) until those platforms are validated.
**Reason:** the app was written cross-platform from the start (`secondary` modifiers, its own
window chrome on Windows, no macOS-only assumptions in shared code), so once the macOS app
shipped the earlier "out of scope" framing no longer held. The dev machine is macOS, which is
why its backend (Metal + font-kit) got first attention.
**Open platform gaps:** notifications and the alert sound are macOS-only stubs; Windows/Linux
native polish and signing remain.

### D6 — Reference, don't vendor
Waku's gpui is a fork (`waku-webview` branch) — **their code is pattern reference, not
copy-paste** for our pinned 0.2.2. Reuse the *designs*: stream veil, one-StyledText-per-block
markdown, highlight-as-paint, coalesced ≤8.3 Hz commits, per-session process management.

### D7 — Provider OAuth is an RPC capability, not client logic
**Choice:** provider authentication is a first-class `auth.*` RPC namespace. Orbit defines the
wire contract (`crates/orbit-rpc/docs/auth-rpc.md`), reduces the events into non-sensitive UI
state (`crates/orbit-pi/src/auth.rs`), and opens authorization URLs with the OS. The **pi**
process implements the server side by reusing its existing provider auth/OAuth implementations
and its `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` credential store. Orbit never implements a provider OAuth flow,
never reads token material, and never persists tokens.

**Rationale:** credential storage and refresh already live in pi; duplicating them in Rust
would fork the source of truth and risk token leakage into GPUI state. Login session ids,
structured error codes, cancellation, timeout, and restart recovery make the async flow
deterministic on the client.

**Compatibility:** a pi build without `auth.*` replies "Unknown command", which Orbit treats as
*unsupported* and falls back to the existing file/Terminal login path. Existing provider
functionality is preserved; nothing is faked.

**Interim server side:** stock pi has no `auth.*` handlers, so `contrib/pi-auth-rpc/apply.mjs`
injects them into an installed pi by wrapping `ModelRuntime.login`/`logout`/`listCredentials`
(reusing pi's OAuth and `auth.json`). It writes a `.orbit-orig` backup and reverts with
`--revert`; re-run it after `pi update`. Upstreaming the handlers is the durable fix.

### D8 — Workflow modes: per-session scope via a `tool_call`/`before_agent_start` extension
**Choice:** a session is scoped **Plan**, **Build**, or **Ask**. Orbit persists the
mode per pi session id in `~/.orbit-pi/workflow.json` (a map), and the bundled
`contrib/orbit-workflow-extension/` reads it fresh on every hook. Plan and Ask drop
the write tools with `pi.setActiveTools`, gate `bash` to a read-only allowlist on
`tool_call`, and inject hidden guidance on `before_agent_start`; Build is the neutral
default. The mode is also written into the session as an `orbit:workflow` entry so
it survives resume and branch.

**Rationale:** pi exposes no RPC command for active tools or the system prompt, so
extension hooks are the only honest mechanism — the same call D1 made for access
modes. Per-session (not global like `access.json`) because scope is a property of
the task, and up to six parked sessions run at once. Reading the store fresh on every
hook re-arms a live session with no restart.

**Residual:** this is a guard, not a sandbox (pi ships none).

### D9 — Localization: `en.yml` is the only hand-edited locale
**Choice:** all user-facing copy goes through the crate-root `tr!` / `tr_cow!` macros
(`crates/orbit-pi/src/i18n.rs`). `locales/en.yml` is the source of truth; the other nine locale
files are generated from the `scripts/i18n_glossary*.py` tables by `scripts/gen_locales.py`, and
`cargo test -p orbit-pi i18n` guards completeness. Ships English, 简体中文, 日本語, 한국어,
Español, Français, Deutsch, Português do Brasil, Русский, Italiano — plus `System`, which walks
the OS preferred-language list and picks the first shipped language.
**Rationale:** ten hand-maintained locale files drift; generated files with an English fallback
and a completeness test keep them honest without blocking releases. Long-lived fields resolve
placeholders from keys at paint time, so a language change is live (including the native menu
bar) without rebuilding them. **Consequence:** new copy adds an `en.yml` key and a glossary
entry — hard-coded English in a render path is a bug.

### D10 — Provider quota: a bundled extension bridge over pi's own credentials
**Choice:** account usage (quota / balance / spend) is read by the bundled
`contrib/orbit-quota-extension/`, loaded with `pi --extension` like the access/workflow guards.
It fetches through pi's own authenticated `ctx.modelRegistry`, appends normalized `orbit:quota`
custom session entries **only when the snapshot changes** (never in LLM context), and the app
polls `get_entries` with a per-session `since` cursor; `crates/orbit-pi/src/quota.rs` reduces
them to non-secret UI state, and `crates/orbit-rpc/docs/quota-rpc.md` is the optional
`quota.list` server contract for a patched pi. Only normalized percentages / counts / resets /
amounts cross the boundary — never a token, key, or account id.
**Rationale:** the same reasoning as D7 — credential storage and refresh already live in pi, so
a Rust re-implementation would fork the source of truth and risk leaking secrets into GPUI
state. The extension path needs no pi patch and degrades to `unsupported` per provider (Gemini,
for example, has no account-quota API). **Residual:** coverage is per-provider and rate-limited;
a report is cached 60 s, and a provider without a verified adapter reports `unsupported` rather
than an invented number.

### D11 — Design tokens: Zed's sizing vocabulary, resolved through Orbit's theme
**Choice:** `crates/orbit-pi/src/theme/tokens.rs` is a one-to-one port of Zed's `ui` crate sizing
tokens: `DynamicSpacing` (Base00–Base48 × three densities), `TextSize` / `HeadlineSize` /
`BufferLineHeight`, `IconSize`, `ButtonSize`, `ListItemSpacing`, the rounded scale, `ElevationIndex`
(Zed's exact shadow stacks) with the `elevation_1/2/3` `StyledExt` helpers, `AnimationDuration`,
and the per-component metrics (list item, list, popover, context menu, modal, tooltip, input
field, scrollbar). Names and numbers follow Zed's source so any value is checkable against it.
Zed's rem (its UI font size, 16px by default) maps onto Orbit's 14px-authored UI font like
`Theme::ui_px`, so every token equals Zed's default pixel value at Orbit's defaults and scales
with the UI font size setting. Zed's Compact / Default / Comfortable densities are anchored at
Spacing Density 80 / 100 / 120 % (exact at the anchors, interpolated between). Colors stay
Orbit's semantic palette — Zed's token set is sizing, elevation, and motion only.
**Rationale:** the UI audit found no shared sizing layer: ~1,200 per-call-site px literals, 17
distinct text sizes, 12 radii, and chrome heights that did not follow the UI font size. Zed is
the canonical GPUI design system, and porting its tokens (rather than inventing a scale) gives
every surface one vocabulary with a proven precedent. **Consequence:** new chrome sizes through
`tokens` instead of literals; surfaces migrate one at a time. Context menus (sidebar session /
workspace, Explorer, Git sync / branch / file), the tooltip, and the extension dialog are on
the tokens, as are the floating modals (provider usage / API-key / provider editor, the update
dialog, and the custom-UI card) via `elevation_3` and the `modal` metrics; the legacy heavier
`popover_shadow` is gone. Sidebar session / workspace rows use Zed's list-item radius and the
`TextSize` / `DynamicSpacing` scales, as do the transcript's message rows, user bubbles, tool /
question card shells, error strips, the usage footer, and the settings section / group / row
chrome and keycap chips. The sidebar's New Task / Search / Usage controls share one
`button_frame(ButtonSize::Large)`. The ad-hoc `Theme::space` (density-only) helper is gone: every spacing
site now resolves through `DynamicSpacing`, so chrome tracks the UI font size as well as
density. UI type is on the `TextSize` scale across every surface (471 of 517 `.text_size` sites);
what remains is sub-10px badge glyphs, 17px+ display headings, and editor / code text. Corner
radii are on the `Radius` scale: gpui's fixed `rounded_sm/md/lg/xl` helpers and every on-scale
`rounded(px(N))` are gone (only 23 off-scale bespoke radii remain). One-shot transitions use
`AnimationDuration`; the looping affordances (spinner, shimmer, streaming pulses) and feedback
timers keep their own cadences, which the three-value scale does not cover. The settings page is
on the token scales throughout — its side nav, headers, sections, rows, toolbars, selects, cards,
and modals read `DynamicSpacing` / `TextSize` / `Radius` / `ButtonSize`, and it has no `ui_px` or
gpui spacing utility left; only bespoke geometry remains (avatar / dot / toggle sizes, fixed
panel and modal widths). The Usage page and its `chart` / `heatmap` / `table` / `filters` /
`tooltip` modules are likewise on the token scales for spacing, type, and radius; only their
chart / table geometry is bespoke. Every single-line input box in the app routes through
`input_field_frame` (or the `input::*` metrics directly, in the extension dialog) — the main
composer, the file editor, and the inline tree rename are the deliberate exceptions, and each is
its own component rather than an `InputField`. Every search box in the app shares one look — the
picker search row (`picker_search_frame`): the command palette, all pickers, the Explorer /
Sidepane filters, the settings / Git / Usage searches, and the transcript find bar. The Git
panel's tab strip and branch row are on the tokens too (one shared `tab_bar` for Changes /
History / Graph / Issues / Pulls). The transcript's inner content (activity bodies, thinking,
edit diffs, detail sections) still carries bespoke layout px.

### D12 — Default session model: Orbit-owned config, applied at spawn and session birth
**Choice:** one optional default model (`provider` + `modelId`) and thinking level for new
sessions, persisted to Orbit's own `~/.orbit-pi/session-defaults.json`. An empty slot means
pi's own startup default is left alone. The choice is applied through both paths a session
can be born on: `--provider` / `--model` / `--thinking` flags at process spawn
(`BundledExtensions::spawn`), which cover the first session, and `set_model` /
`set_thinking_level` RPC for every later `new_session` inside a live process.
`switch_session` and `clone` deliberately do not override a resumed session. Settings →
Agent exposes the model plus a thinking-level select whose options are derived from the
catalog entry exactly like pi's `getSupportedThinkingLevels` (`reasoning` +
`thinkingLevelMap`); a model or level pi's catalog does not support is skipped, and a
malformed file loads as no default. Per-mode defaults were deliberately dropped: mode is a
per-session scope (D8), not a reason for a different startup model, and the composer chip
already changes model/thinking per session.
**Rationale:** one pi process hosts many sessions and a `new_session` re-applies the
spawn-time CLI flags to each one, but those flags are frozen at spawn: a default
changed while the process is live would only reach a new session through the RPC
path, and RPC alone would leave the first session on pi's global default. Orbit owns
the file for the same reason themes do (D9):
`~/.pi/agent/settings.json` is global to the machine, is rewritten by pi itself, and
writing it would silently change terminal `pi` sessions. Deriving the thinking ladder from
the catalog keeps the settings control honest for the selected model instead of showing
the live session's levels; fail-soft keeps a stale id or level from poisoning a session.
**Consequence:** new sessions only — a resumed session keeps the model and thinking level
recorded in its file, and a manual composer choice wins until the next new session.

### D13 — Command registry is the source of truth for keys, palette, and help
**Choice:** app commands live in one static table (`crates/orbit-pi/src/commands.rs`): id,
category, title/detail i18n keys, icon, palette/help flags, and the advertised chord.
`BINDINGS` rows name the chord, key context, and command, and `key_bindings()` turns them
into the typed gpui bindings that `bind_keys` installs first. The command palette builds
its rows from the registry; Settings → Shortcuts renders the same table; both label
chords through `platform::shortcuts::label`, which formats canonical chords
(`secondary-n`) per platform. Text-entry conventions and modal keymaps stay literal in
`bind_keys` — they are conventions, not commands. Tests reject duplicate
(chord, context) pairs, missing specs, missing keymap rows, and chords that do not parse.
**Rationale:** the previous layout had four sources for one shortcut (the keymap literal,
hand-typed glyph constants, palette items, and the settings reference) which had already
drifted: `cmd-` bindings never fired on Windows/Linux, and `secondary-period` advertised
a chord gpui never matches (the key is `.`). One table makes drift impossible at
test time and is the only way “discoverable keyboard-first” stays true as commands are
added.
**Consequence:** a new app command is added once — spec, `BINDINGS` row, and a `CommandId`
run arm — and appears in the palette, the shortcut reference, and the keymap together.
Context actions (the review tree, Git tabs) are registry commands too, but never palette
rows.

### D14 — Git worktrees are workspaces, not a parallel filesystem
**Choice:** a Git worktree is modeled by a dedicated `WorktreeManager`
(`crates/orbit-pi/src/worktree.rs`, with the optional setup script in
`worktree_setup.rs`) and driven only through the `git worktree` porcelain; the UI
(`app/worktrees.rs`) consumes that abstraction. Opening a worktree sets
`current_workspace` and adds it to the project list like any other folder — the
Explorer, terminal, Git page, Review, MCP scope, file watcher, and agent read that one
path, so no second filesystem abstraction exists. Worktree **name**, **branch**, and
**path** stay separate identities; renames move only the directory.
**Rationale:** sessions already persist an absolute `cwd`, and every consumer already
reads the active workspace path. A separate worktree-specific layer would duplicate
that plumbing and create a second source of truth for “where the agent runs”. The
porcelain requirement (never editing `.git/worktrees` or `.git/config` by hand) keeps
Orbit compatible with Git's own metadata format across versions.
**Consequence:** new workspace-scoped features get worktree support for free by honoring
`current_workspace`; worktree lifecycle/UI changes stay in `worktree.rs` / `app/worktrees.rs`.
A missing worktree surfaces a notice rather than silently re-pointing a session at the
main repository.

## The feature parity contract

Everything below must behave identically in the GPUI app (against the pi CLI) as it does in the
legacy app today:

1. Chat sessions — prompt composer, model selection, thinking-effort, steer/cancel/abort, streaming
2. Sessions grouped by project, persistent, reopenable, cross-workspace
3. Model catalog from pi's own list; thinking levels per model
4. Tool activity (bash, edit, todo, plan, search, mcp, thinking, question) + approval dialogs
5. Git diff panel + file-change blocks
6. Workbench pages — usage (charts + activity heatmap), skills, plugins, models, providers
   (CRUD + OAuth/quota), settings; Explorer + Files editor, integrated terminal, Git/GitHub,
   and the in-app updater with Version History
7. Markdown — GFM, syntax-highlighted code, copy-able code blocks, image lightbox
8. Theming — dark/light palettes, accent, font, density, reduce-motion. Persisted to **Orbit's own store** (`~/.orbit-pi/{theme,ui.json,fonts.json}`), not pi's settings: theme/UI state is Orbit's, and writing it into pi's config would fork pi's own source of truth. (Revised from "persisted to pi's settings".)
9. Attachments — files read to base64 images for prompts
10. macOS native expectations — traffic lights, a native menu bar (Orbit/File/Edit/View, rebuilt
    on language change), native dialogs, keyboard operability. Orbit's actions are also exposed
    as keyboard/mouse surfaces (⌘P palette, shortcuts), not only through menus.

### Implementation status (living)

Done: streaming transcript + virtualization; markdown + highlighting; composer with steering, follow-ups, cancel, autocomplete, attachments; extension dialogs; diff/Review + Git page + GitHub issues/PRs (where `gh` is available); sessions (list/switch/new/delete/clone/cross-workspace) over an Orbit-owned project list (only folders the user added; removing one never touches pi) whose groups sort by activity, added date, name, or session count, with a **warm process pool** so re-opening a recent session is a resume, not a Node spawn; Git worktrees as first-class workspaces (`worktree.rs` + the Worktrees page: discovery, create from a new/existing branch, open/rename/move/lock/remove/prune/repair, configurable `.wt` root, optional async setup script with `ORBIT_ROOT_PATH`/`ORBIT_WORKTREE_PATH`, sessions rooted in and restored to the worktree — D14); Explorer project panel + editable Files surface; integrated terminal (⌘J); usage, skills, plugins, models, providers, settings pages; transcript find; image lightbox; theming (dark/light/system, 43 palettes) + reduce-motion; localization (ten locales + System, D9); in-app signed updater + Version History; notifications; open-in-editor; signed/notarizable macOS packaging + best-effort Windows/Linux bundles (D5); CI; access modes (a guard, not a sandbox), workflow modes (Plan/Build/Ask per D8), and the auto-title / quota extension bridges (D10); Zed design tokens (D11) with context menus, the tooltip, the extension dialog, the floating modal cards (provider usage / API-key / editor, update dialog, custom UI), the sidebar session / workspace rows, the transcript's message / card chrome, the settings section / group / row chrome, UI type on `TextSize` across every surface, corner radii on `Radius`, and one-shot motion on `AnimationDuration` migrated onto them.

Every icon-only button carries the app's native tooltip — a localized label, usually
with its shortcut appended (the send / stop button set the register) — across the top
bar, sidebar, transcript copy / diff controls, composer add button, window caption
buttons, Explorer, Review pane, Git, Usage, terminal, settings, and the picker / dialog
controls, so no glyph is a guess.

The Git page's **Issues** and **Pull requests** tabs gained a **Generate** action: the
**New issue** and **New pull request** forms take optional free-form notes, then draft a
title and Markdown body with the same one-shot, tool-free `pi -p` call the commit-message
button uses (`issue_message.rs`), falling back to a local heuristic built from the branch's
commits and changed files when pi is unavailable. The forms also read the repository's own
templates (`gh_templates.rs`): a lone issue/PR template applies automatically, several are
chosen from a **Template** picker, the body is prefilled with the template's skeleton (YAML
issue forms are flattened to Markdown), the template's title prefix and labels are applied,
and the generator is told to fill the template faithfully. Those tabs were also tightened
for scanning — labels collapse to `+N`, every row ends in a fixed relative-time column, and
the PR list drops its duplicated state pill — and the PR detail now shares the issue
detail's reading-column + metadata-rail layout (review, checks, changes, branches,
timeline).

The in-app bug report (Settings → Report a bug) picks an issue type (bug /
feature / other, which sets the GitHub label and the generated section
headings), takes free-form context at the top, and drafts the issue title and
description from it with the app's active model — the same one-shot, tool-free
`pi -p` call the Git page's generator uses (`issue_message.rs`), with a
kind-aware prompt that returns a heading-free description so the form supplies
the section headings; when pi is unavailable the draft falls back to the notes
themselves. Screenshots are supported too: they upload with
`gh issue create --attach` when `gh` is signed in (Orbit writes them to a temp
directory first), and a `gh` missing that flag or a signed-out `gh` degrades to
GitHub's prefilled web form with the images saved for the user to drag in.
Filing goes to `imrj05/orbit` with the machine's build details attached — Orbit
version, app ID (`dev.orbit.pi`), OS and architecture, install kind, pi CLI
version, and the signed-in `gh` account — through `gh issue create --repo` when
the CLI is installed and authenticated, falling back to GitHub's new-issue page
with the title, body, and label prefilled. `gh` keeps ownership of the token:
Orbit still never stores one (`bug_report.rs`).

Composer sending is configurable in Settings → Agent → Behavior: Enter queues a follow-up
by default or steers the running task, with Alt/Option+Enter selecting the opposite mode.
The explicit ⌘⇧Enter / Ctrl+Shift+Enter steering shortcut stays fixed. The choice is a
live, global Orbit UI preference (`composer_send_mode` in `~/.orbit-pi/ui.json`), not a
pi setting; it affects future sends only, never an existing queue. Idle sends remain
normal prompts. Compact Send/Steer/Queue hints sit on the right side of the composer
footer, immediately left of the context-window indicator, without a newline hint.
These persistent hints, button tooltips, and the Shortcuts reference track the
preference, with dedicated chat-only shortcut context to protect other fields.
Non-blocking optional model questions remain outside this change.

Compaction and branch summaries are visible in the transcript: pi's
`compactionSummary` / `branchSummary` context messages now render as boundary
cards ("Compaction — Compacted from N tokens", click to expand the summary
markdown) instead of being filtered out, and a successful `compaction_end`
re-reads `get_messages` so the live chat adopts pi's compacted projection
(summary + kept entries) instead of holding the pre-compaction history until
the session is reopened.

The keyboard layer is command-registry driven (`commands.rs`, D13): every app
command declares its chord once, and the command palette, Settings →
Shortcuts, and tooltips all render from that table. The palette gained session
rename/pin/clone/delete, model and thinking pickers (⌘⇧M / ⌘⇧T), Review
(⌘⇧R), and the shortcut reference (⌘/). Session management is number- and
cycle-addressable: ⌘1…⌘9 open the Nth session in the sidebar's visible order
and Ctrl+Tab / Ctrl+Shift+Tab cycle sessions (the Git page tabs moved to
⌘⌥1…⌘⌥6 to free the numbers). Hover hints come from the same registry
(`commands::tooltip`), so the model/thinking chips, New Task, Search/Usage
rows, top-bar toggles, and Git tabs name their chord on hover — and a session
row shows its ⌘1…⌘9 slot. The Review pane is fully keyboard navigable —
Tab / Shift-Tab traverse the workbench's focus stops (composer, sidebar,
review tree, terminal, Explorer), the tree takes arrows and Enter, and
`n`/`p` jump changed files, `[`/`]` hunks, `e`/`c` expand or collapse every
file, Escape returns to the chat; the composer's autocomplete and the terminal
keep Tab for themselves. `secondary` chords replaced the macOS-only `cmd-`
bindings (Editor clipboard/undo/save, Files close, Git tabs), so Windows and
Linux get the same shortcuts, and the dead ⌘. abort chord was fixed (gpui's key
name is `.`, not `period`).

Open: migrating the remaining surfaces (the settings page's toolbars / cards / controls, transcript inner content, the modal bodies' inner text, the remaining sub-10px / 17px+ type, and off-scale radii) onto the D11 tokens; drawn scrollbars (gpui 0.2.2 draws none); conversation **fork/rewind** (clone exists; rewind needs entry ids); on-device scroll-perf measurement; stream veil + an explicit ≤8.3 Hz streaming commit pipeline; screen-reader labeling (gpui 0.2.2 exposes no accessibility tree); richer per-tool renderers (bash/thinking are dedicated, the rest generic).

## Non-goals (explicitly out of scope)

- Any web technology in the UI — no webview surfaces as UI, no React, no HTML/CSS
- Multi-provider support à la Waku (pi only; Oh My Pi *may* come later as a second RPC flavor)
- Always-latest GPUI (the app is pinned, D4)
- Fabricating permission modes, diagrams, or perf claims the protocol/renderer can't deliver

## Phases — outcome (the original plan, kept for the record)

The staged plan below is history: P0–P4 shipped and P5/P6 are partial. The GPUI app is the only
app (D3), so this is a status board rather than a forward schedule. `cargo run -p orbit-pi` is
the product; the per-item detail lives in AGENT.md.

| Phase | Deliverable | Status |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | Transport + workspace + process spawner + RPC client + first live round-trip | ✅ Shipped |
| P1 | Shell, theme, fonts, sidebar sessions | ✅ Shipped |
| P2 | Data layer: serde models, sessions/catalog/workbench clients | ✅ Shipped |
| P3 | Core chat: transcript, streaming, markdown, composer, tools, diff | ✅ Shipped (stream veil + explicit ≤8.3 Hz pipeline open) |
| P4 | Workbench pages + settings persistence | ✅ Shipped (plus Explorer/Files, terminal, Git/GitHub, localization, updater) |
| P5 | Mermaid fallback + a11y | ◐ Mermaid code-block fallback + reduce-motion shipped; app-wide focus rings + screen-reader labeling open |
| P6 | Tests, perf harness, packaging/notarization, CI | ◐ Unit/live tests, 10k perf test, signed `.app`/DMG, CI shipped; on-device scroll benchmark + streaming edge coverage open |

Open backlog (detail in AGENT.md): conversation fork/rewind, on-device scroll-perf measurement,
stream veil, explicit streaming commit pipeline, app-wide focus rings, screen-reader labeling, richer
per-tool renderers, Windows/Linux native polish.

## Top risks (with mitigations)

1. **P3 scope** — *resolved:* was the dominant estimate (25–40 days); it shipped by keeping the
   Waku pattern map (AGENT.md), one-StyledText-per-block markdown from day one, and tool
   renderers by spec.
2. **Tool approval protocol gap (D1 residual)** — resolved: pi exposes no native per-tool permission in RPC mode, so Orbit enforces access modes through a bundled `tool_call` extension that prompts via `ctx.ui.select` (Allow once / Always allow this tool / Deny), rendered natively as an inline bar.
3. **Composer editor** — *resolved:* the multi-line `ComposerInput` (`EntityInputHandler`) has
   shipped, wrapping, auto-growing, and scrolling. Reuse it for new text controls rather than
   introducing another editor abstraction.
4. **Mermaid regression** — accepted; D2 path chosen, fallback never fakes.
5. **GPUI churn** — pinned 0.2.2 (D4); upgrade = its own task with the registry source as docs.
6. **Velocity** — Rust UI iteration is 3–5× slower than React hot-reload; the estimates assume
   this, not hope.
