//! The **Git page** — a full main-area surface (like Settings) with three tabs
//! and a commit bar.
//!
//! - **Changes**: staged/unstaged file lists with per-file stage, unstage, and
//!   discard; the commit bar combines the branch, a conventional-commit input,
//!   a one-shot generate button, and Commit / Commit and push / Push.
//! - **History**: the current branch's commit log with refs, author, and
//!   relative time.
//! - **Graph**: every local branch drawn as a lane graph over the same commit
//!   metadata, laid out by [`crate::git::layout_graph`].
//!
//! All Git I/O runs on the background executor; the page paints cached state
//! and is owned by [`crate::app::OrbitApp`].
