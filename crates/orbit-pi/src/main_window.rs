//! Opening — and re-opening — the app's one main window.
//!
//! macOS does not quit an app when its last window closes. The Dock icon
//! stays (with the running dot), and clicking it asks the app to show a
//! window again: `applicationShouldHandleReopen:hasVisibleWindows:`, which
//! GPUI surfaces as [`Application::on_reopen`]. An app that never installs a
//! handler answers nothing, so the Dock click is a no-op and only a full quit
//! brings a window back. Orbit installs one here.
//!
//! Reopening restores the *same* shell rather than building a second one —
//! see [`Shell`].
