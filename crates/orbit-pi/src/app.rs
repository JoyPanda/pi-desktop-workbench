//! The Orbit shell model: the `OrbitApp` struct (shared state), the
//! `Render`/`Focusable` entry points, and the feature modules that drive it.
//!
//! This file keeps the state model, the shared types, and the controller
//! wiring. Feature logic lives in descendant modules (see the map at the
//! bottom of the file), which can reach the struct's private fields directly:
//!
//! - [`runtime`] — pi process lifecycle, status/error, provider auth
//! - [`events`] — the heartbeat: event drain, responses, session watcher
//! - [`session`] — prompt/queue/turn lifecycle and navigation
//! - [`pickers`] — model, command-palette, branch, and workspace pickers
//! - [`pi_update_ui`] — the launch-time pi self-update: check, install, report
//! - [`composer_ops`] — autocomplete, attachments, add-menu, model chips
//! - [`sidebar`] — session/workspace sidebar rendering + row menus
//! - [`settings`] — Settings surface (General/Runtime/Agent/Skills/Plugins/Providers)
//! - [`skills_ui`] — Settings → Skills master-detail page + controllers
//! - [`toast_ui`] — the in-app toast stack: push/dismiss helpers and layer
//! - [`view`] — top-level chrome: sidebar, transcript, composer, status bar
//! - [`open_in`] — "open workspace in" app detection and menu
//! - [`helpers`] — icons, file glyphs, and small formatting helpers
