//! Transcript paint — transcript layout, honest Orbit data.
//!
//! Rows are plain GPUI flex trees (no component library): user turns are
//! End-aligned neutral bubbles, assistant turns are Start-aligned prose. A
//! ghost copy/timestamp footer reveals on row hover. Settled: **Worked for**
//! fold → thinking/tool cards → answer → files → copy footer. Live: thinking
//! and activity cards → answer → files → **Working for** — work stays in
//! sequence with the text as it arrives from the agent.
//!
//! Timestamps render on the footer when pi provides one (snapshot
//! `timestamp` fields, or a wall-clock stamp taken at `message_end`).
//! A settled assistant footer also forks the conversation through that
//! reply. Not painted (pi does not provide them): git Review and per-tool
//! checkpoint diffs — an edit/write tool instead shows an inline diff
//! built from its own `oldText`/`newText` arguments.
